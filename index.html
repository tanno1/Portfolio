            Hello! If you have found yourself on this page, it is either work related or I directed you here bceause I am proud of it!
            Anyways, I am an experienced, creative individual with years of experience in a multitude of industries from startup clothing companies to industry leading electric automotive companies. <br>
            I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechatronics at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA. I expect
            to graduate in the fall of 2023 at which point I will start working for a hands-on engineering startup Some of my interests are consumer electronics, industrial design, 
            artificial intelligence, gaming, aerospace, and automation. In my free time, I skateboard, game, draw, design clothes, and practice programming through
            designing websites or making applications. <br>
