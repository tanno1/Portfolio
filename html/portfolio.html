                    One of my most recent and involved projects is my dirtbike, a 2011 KX250 F. I purchased this bike in very poor condition at the beginning of 2021. this was my
                    first project with a four stroke engine. The first thing I noticed was for fluid leaking out of the front fork seals. I dove right into the forks and 
                    replaced the seals, dust caps, and fork fluid. As a precaution, I also dissasembled the preloader and cleaned it up as well. Next, I replaced the chain, sprokets, and
                    brake system. This project has taught me a lot about maintaining engines, how they operate, and given me hands on experience with diagnosing problems and solving them. One of the next projects I will do is rebuild the top end of the engine.

                    My first true engineering project began in my sophomore year of
                    high school. I purchased a poorly maintained JS 440 stand up jet ski for $200 on craigslist and fixed it up  over the summer. This was a long process and required lots of planning and time. Some of the relevant things I did were: replace all fuel lines,
                    replace all gaskets, add a radius limiting disk for
                    turning that I cut with an oxy fuel torch, and replace
                    the battery, stator and flywheel. I also replaced the
                    electrical box and fully rewired every electrical
                    component. I did a few cosmetic upgrades as well
                    and replaced the grips, side mat and buttons. To this
                    day I still ride the ski in the summer and it functions
                    flawlessly after all the work I did.

                    Last year, I received a Tech Grant from my University and I used it to purchase parts
                    to build my own top of the line PC. Computers have always been a passion of mine,
                    and the experience of selecting components and assembling them taught me more about
                    how PC parts work, and how to diagnose issues. Since I have gotten this PC, I have
                    been programing consistently, working on projects for myself and also building
                    websites similar to this one for my friends.

                    Pacer is a company I have ran for the past four years. Starting from the 
                    ground up with the vision of making clothing, my friend Jake Strahm and I
                    started screen printing T shirts in my basement. Through constant hard 
                    work we generated over $30,000 of revenue, produced everything from a T 
                    shirt to rugs, hats, cargo pants, jeans, and even 3D printed figurines 
                    that I designed in Blender. Pacer to this day is a registered business 
                    and it has had a great impact on helping me learn how to overcome 
                    obstacles to design what I want, how to manage large sums of money, 
                    how to pay taxes, and how to organize events for hundreds of people 
                    to attend. In the downloadable file there are images of some of the 
                    things we have made.

                    Similar to Pacer, Identity4 is a new clothing comapny that I have started
                    with Jake. We want to expand our scope of designs and make more products
                    related to skateboarding, street culture, and film. The direction for 
                    Identity4, or I4, is very different than Pacer, so rather than change
                    Pacer, we created I4.
